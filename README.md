# Healthy Heart Rate

This project is about monitoring Heart Rate, in Beat Per Minute (BPM), through an Android App and Smartwatch.
Heart beats are showing as a % of the Maximum Heart Rate, calculed with Karvonen formula. Plus personalized Heart Rate Zones give indication (if heart rate value is normal). These zones are customised, thanks to Profile settings, in terms of sexe, age, Heart Rate at Rest and Maximum Heart Rate, according to a reliable algorithm based on the recognised Karvonen formula and Astrand method. 
Values can be shared via Facebook or keep it private.
